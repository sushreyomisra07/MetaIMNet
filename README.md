# MetaIMNet
Codes and Input Datasets required to train and test MetaIMNet surrogate models and compare to Traditional Surrogate Models.
The codes are in python and the demonstrations are provided in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. It uses "pytorch" and "sklearn" libraries for the machine learning tasks.

The Jupyter Notebooks are annotated as follows. 
  * TradNet_classification_train.ipynb: Train the TradNet classification model and check model performance
  * TradNet_regression_train.ipynb: Train the TradNet regression model and check model performance
  * MetaIMNet_classification_train.ipynb: Train the MetaIMNet classification model and check model performance
  * MetaIMNet_regression_train.ipynb: Train the MetaIMNet regression model and check model performance
